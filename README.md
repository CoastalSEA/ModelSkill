# ModelSkill
Matlab App for exploring the skill score between timeseries data sets or
gridded data sets.

## Licence
The code is provided as Open Source code (issued under a BSD 3-clause License).

## Requirements
ModelSkill is written in Matlab(TM) and requires v2016b, or later. In addition, ModelSkill requires the _dstoolbox_ and the _muitoolbox_.

## Background
The ModelSkill App enables data to be loaded and then compared on a Taylor diagram. This form of plot was originally proposed for the 
comparison of model timeseries output (Taylor, 2001) and has subsequently been adapted for the comparison of morphological model outputs (Bosboom and Reniers, 2014; Bosboom et al., 2014). In this implementation the Taylor approach is used but modified in line with the mehtod proposed by Bosboom for the analysis of grid and mesh data. The options include the ability to create and add points to a Taylor diagram, output the results to the Clipboard, and estimate global and local skill scores.
